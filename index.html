            <p>Hello! I'm a current sophomore in college, going for a Cybersecurity degree. Before this I had done 6 years in the Navy as a mechanic on an aircraft carrier. 
                I was on the nuclear end since our carriers have nuclear reactors to power them, so that took about 2 years of training and 4 years of service on the ship itself.
                While being a mechanic was an interesting experience, I felt it wasn't quite the fit I was looking for, and I've always had an interest in computers. I figured I would
                use the GI Bill to get a head start on a college degree, and cybersecurity sounded great for career opportunities. Aside from that, I have small hobbies playing boardgames
                and videogames with friends, going hiking or fishing here in Colorado, and seein movies at the theatre.
            </p>
