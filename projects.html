            <div class="card">
                <div class="card-body">This is the first project I've done in recent years, as I can't really disclose
                    what I've worked on while in the Navy. I've learned how to do basic coding utilizing html. I use
                    Github as a repository and VsCode as an IDE. I also learned hot to use Bootstrap 5 to style and
                    format webpages. All of my progress is reflected on my Github that I linked on the Summary page</div>

            <h2>Project 2: Mechanical Engineering Projects at CU Boulder</h2>
            <div class="card">
                <div class="card-body">A few years ago before the military, I was a mechanical engineering student at CU
                    Boulder, Colorado. One of the classes I had was entirely about working on a project with a team, and
                    my team created remotely-activated blinds to use for a window. My main role was using Solidworks to
                    design and 3-D print parts we needed, then help put the pieces together physically. We also dabbled
                    in Arduino to use as our electronic end to oerate the blinds.</div>

            <h2>Project 3: High School Technology Students Association (TSA)</h2>
            <div class="card">
                <div class="card-body">For all of highshool I was in TSA as an extracurricular. This class was all about
                    problem-solving and designing projects such as catacpults, rubber-band racecars, or technical
                    drawings in order to compete at a state level. One of my more proud memories was winning a gold
                    medal with my close friends for designing a catapult together. We spent several months creating
                    blueprints, designing, testing, and reiterating on our catapult until we got it to exceed the
                    expectations of the competition. I use Solidworks a lot for this too, but most of it was hands-on
                    manufacturing and testing of the catapult with my team. I also got silver medals for accurate
                    technical drawing skills and rubber-band car racing</div>
